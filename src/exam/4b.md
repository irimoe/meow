# Task 4b: evaluation 

## general clean up

i made some modifications to the existing codebase to ensure that the codebase remained maintainable and readable, and so that it adhered by established conventions.

### menus 

first of all, i created two classes, `MainMenuChoice` and `AverageMenuChoice` to serve as enumerations for menu options, which provides several benefits over just hard coding the numbers, as was done previously, including:

1. **improved code readability** as we're using well-named constants instead of the previous magic strings/numbers, making it easier to understand the code, for example, what an `if` block is for at a glance, and 
3. **error prevention** reduces the risk of typos when referencing menu options throughout the cod4. **easier Maintenance**: Adding or modifying menu options requires changing only one location

For example:
```python
class MainMenuChoice:
    AVERAGE_INTERACTION = "1"
    EXIT = "0"
```

so, this makes the code more maintainable and understandable as the menu options can be referenced through meaningful names, rather than a literal value that you have to keep scrolling back for.
 
### input validation

i implemented the `get_validated_input()` function to handle user input validation in a consistent way across the program. the function:

1. takes a prompt message and a list of valid options,
2. continuously prompts the user until they provide valid input,
3. provides clear error messages when invalid options are selected, and
4. returns the validated choice

previously, validation code was repeated across the two menu functions:

```py
def main_menu():
    # ...
    try:
        int(choice)
    except:
        print("Sorry, you did not enter a valid option")
        flag = True
    else:    
        print('Choice accepted!')
        flag = False

    return choice

def average_menu ():
    # ...
    try:
        int(choice)
        except:
            print("Sorry, you did not enter a valid option")
            flag = True
        else:    
            print('Choice accepted!')
            flag = False
            
    return choice
```

i also added some colours in to make it a *bit more engaging* and less boring to look at and use.


### display functions

The `display_header()` function creates consistent visual separation between different program sections, improving user experience by:

1. clearing the screen before displaying new content to avoid visual clutter and clearly show the new content fornt and center,
2. creating a visually distinct header with the section title, and
3. adding appropriate spacing for better readability.

the `clear_screen()` helper function handles both windows and unix-like operating systems. 
```py
'cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear'
```


### error handling

The `load_data()` function implements robust error handling for CSV file operations:

1. **`FileNotFoundError`**: when the specified file doesn't exist,
2. **`EmptyDataError`**: when the file *exists* but contains no data, and
3. **`ParserError`**: when the file format doesn't match expected csv structure, for example, if the file is empty or it's in a different format.

this prevents the program from exiting unexpectedly and provides clearer feedback to the user about the issue, instead of just crashing with a python traceback that a regular user would not understand.

### data analysis

the `get_avg_data()` function performs the core data analysis of the application:

1. groups data by date using pandas' `groupby()` function
2. calculates means for the specified interaction metric
3. formats results into a readable table with proper alignment
4. includes an overall average calculation
5. handles missing columns gracefully with error messages

This implementation demonstrates effective use of pandas for data manipulation and presentation.

### program structure

#### outer-inner loop design

i implemented a two-level menu system with a main loop and nested interaction loops:

1. the outer loop handles the main menu, allowing exit or navigation to sub-menus, and
2. the inner loop manages specific analytics functions with the capability to return to the outer loop.

so, the outer loop is responsible for the main menu, and the inner loop handles the other menus. this provides a clearer navigation flow for the user, and means that they don't have to continuously rerun the code to access different features.

#### function Separation

i separated some code into its own, distinct function, helping make the code more modular and easier to maintain, adhering to established coding practices.

1. **ui functions**: handling display and user interaction (`display_header`, `main_menu`, etc.)
2. **data functions**: managing data loading and processing (`load_data`, `get_avg_data`)
3. **utility functions**: providing helper functionality (`clear_screen`, `convert_avg_menu_choice`)
