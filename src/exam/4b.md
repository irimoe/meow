# Task 4b: evaluation 

## general clean up

i made some modifications to the existing codebase to ensure that the codebase remained maintainable and readable, and so that it adhered by established conventions.

### menus 

first of all, i created two classes, `MainMenuChoice` and `AverageMenuChoice` to serve as enumerations for menu options, which provides several benefits over just hard coding the numbers, as was done previously, including:

1. **improved code readability** as we're using well-named constants instead of the previous magic strings/numbers, making it easier to understand the code, for example, what an `if` block is for at a glance, and 
3. **error prevention** reduces the risk of typos when referencing menu options throughout the cod4. **easier Maintenance**: Adding or modifying menu options requires changing only one location

For example:
```python
class MainMenuChoice:
    AVERAGE_INTERACTION = "1"
    EXIT = "0"
```

so, this makes the code more maintainable and understandable as the menu options can be referenced through meaningful names, rather than a literal value that you have to keep scrolling back for.
 
### input validation

i implemented the `get_validated_input()` function to handle user input validation in a consistent way across the program. the function:

1. takes a prompt message and a list of valid options,
2. continuously prompts the user until they provide valid input,
3. provides clear error messages when invalid options are selected, and
4. returns the validated choice

previously, validation code was repeated across the two menu functions:

```py
def main_menu():
    # ...
    try:
        int(choice)
    except:
        print("Sorry, you did not enter a valid option")
        flag = True
    else:    
        print('Choice accepted!')
        flag = False

    return choice

def average_menu ():
    # ...
    try:
        int(choice)
        except:
            print("Sorry, you did not enter a valid option")
            flag = True
        else:    
            print('Choice accepted!')
            flag = False
            
    return choice
```

i also added some colours in to make it a *bit more engaging* and less boring to look at and use.


### display functions

The `display_header()` function creates consistent visual separation between different program sections, improving user experience by:

1. clearing the screen before displaying new content to avoid visual clutter and clearly show the new content fornt and center,
2. creating a visually distinct header with the section title, and
3. adding appropriate spacing for better readability.

the `clear_screen()` helper function handles both windows and unix-like operating systems. 
```py
'cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear'
```


### error handling

The `load_data()` function implements robust error handling for CSV file operations:

1. **`FileNotFoundError`**: when the specified file doesn't exist,
2. **`EmptyDataError`**: when the file *exists* but contains no data, and
3. **`ParserError`**: when the file format doesn't match expected csv structure, for example, if the file is empty or it's in a different format.

this prevents the program from exiting unexpectedly and provides clearer feedback to the user about the issue, instead of just crashing with a python traceback that a regular user would not understand.

### data analysis

the `get_avg_data()` function performs the core data analysis of the application:

1. groups data by date using pandas' `groupby()` function
2. calculates means for the specified interaction metric
3. formats results into a readable table with proper alignment
4. includes an overall average calculation
5. handles missing columns gracefully with error messages

This implementation demonstrates effective use of pandas for data manipulation and presentation.

### program structure

#### outer-inner loop design

i implemented a two-level menu system with a main loop and nested interaction loops:

1. the outer loop handles the main menu, allowing exit or navigation to sub-menus, and
2. the inner loop manages specific analytics functions with the capability to return to the outer loop.

so, the outer loop is responsible for the main menu, and the inner loop handles the other menus. this provides a clearer navigation flow for the user, and means that they don't have to continuously rerun the code to access different features.

#### function Separation

i separated some code into its own, distinct function, helping make the code more modular and easier to maintain, adhering to established coding practices.

1. **ui functions**: handling display and user interaction (`display_header`, `main_menu`, etc.)
2. **data functions**: managing data loading and processing (`load_data`, `get_avg_data`)
3. **utility functions**: providing helper functionality (`clear_screen`, `convert_avg_menu_choice`)

## system requirements

the system requirements for gurreb's bbq sales analysis tool specified that the solution should be able to analyze sales data for:
1. specific menu items over time,
2. comparison of lunch and dinner sales, and
3. identifying top-selling menu items.

my solution meets all of these requirements through the following implementations:

### analysis of specific menu items

the `analyse_item_sales()` function provides an analysis of individual menu items by:

1. filtering data for the selected item and date range,
2. calculating daily sales quantities and totals,
3. generating clear graphical representations of sales trends over time, and
4. providing a clear textual summary including total units sold and revenue generated.

this meets the requirement to show sales of specific menu items over time.

### lunch vs dinner comparison

the `analyse_meal_trends()` function handles the comparison between lunch and dinner services by:

1. performing separate analyses for each meal type,
2. calculating and displaying metrics like total sales and daily averages, and
3. displaying differences between meal types.

this satisfies the requirement to identify trends between lunch and dinner services.

### top selling items analysis

the `find_top_items()` function identifies the best-performing menu items by:

1. ranking items based on the quantity sold,
2. providing visual comparisons through bar charts,
3. calculating supporting metrics like average daily sales, and
4. clearly highlighting the top performers in both categories.

this meets the requirement to identify the menu items with the highest total and average sales.

### data handling security

i didn't see much opportunity nor need to implement any security measures, as the data is only being read from a csv file and nothing is being communicated over the network.

## user requirements

gurreb's bbq specified that the solution should be easy to use, display information meaningfully, and make appropriate use of textual, numerical, and graphical outputs. i address these requirements through the following implementations:

### ease of use

the interface is designed to be user-friendly, with:

1. a clear menu system with numbered options and consistent navigation,
2. input validation with helpful error messages that guides users toward correct inputs,
3. colour coding to make the interface more visually appealing, engaging, and to highlight important information,
4. confirmation prompts and clear transitions between pages that prevent information overload.

error messages are also clear and informative, instead of just crashing with a python traceback that a regular user would not understand.

### meaningful information display

my solution presents information in a structured, meaningful way through:

1. well-formatted tables with aligned columns and clear headers,
2. colour-highlighted key insights and conclusions that draw attention to relevant data,
3. consistent use of headers and separators to organise information logically, and
4. summaries that include both raw numbers and understandable insights (like percentage differences).

## potential further development

while the current solution does meet core requirements, there are several ways it could be further developed to provide even more value:

### enhanced analysis capabilities

the analysis functionality could be expanded to include:

1. **seasonal trend analysis**: identifying patterns in menu item popularity across different seasons,
2. **item pairing analysis**: discovering which items are commonly ordered together, this isn't currently possible with the current data made available, and
3. **price sensitivity modeling**: analysing how price changes affect sales volumes for different items.

### additional data sources

the solution could be extended to incorporate additional data sources:

1. **inventory data**: connecting sales to something like ingredient usage,
2. **cost data**: integrating food costs to calculate profit margins by item, and
3. **weather data**: correlating sales patterns with weather conditions.

### technical improvements

the code structure could be further improved through:

1. **object-oriented design**: organizing the application into classes that encapsulate related data and behaviors,
2. **configuration files**: allowing customization of options without code changes, e.g., plot file paths and the csv file path, and
3. **automated testing**: implementing unit and integration tests to ensure reliability as features are added.

these technical enhancements would make the application more maintainable and extensible over time.

### user experience upgrades

the user interface could be enhanced with:

1. **web frontend**: creating a browser-based interface that doesn't require the command line, and
2. **scheduled reports**: allowing users to set up automatic analysis runs.

these improvements would make the application more accessible to all members of staff and also make it more convenient for everyday use.
